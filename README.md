# Purpose

Youtube comments are full of shit-tier scams, this filters them by looking at comments and removing them if they include certain "trigger words" that real people don't really use, except scammers.

# Contributing
Feel free to submit pull-requests with more words included into the `forbiddenWords` array in content.js

Currently it's only:

```
[
    'financial advisor',
    'personal finances',
    'financial independence',
    'trader',
    'my investment decisions',
    'Building wealth'
]
```
